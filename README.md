# Pro To-Do List Dark Theme
## Project Overview
## Project Overview
The Pro To-Do List Dark Theme is a clean, modern, and user-friendly task management web application built entirely with Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The app allows users to:

- **Add tasks** with optional due dates and priority levels (Low, Medium, High).  
- **Mark tasks as complete** or undo completed tasks.  
- **Delete tasks** when they are no longer needed.  
- **Filter tasks** by status: All, Pending, or Completed.  
- **Persistent storage** using the browserâ€™s Local Storage API, ensuring tasks remain even after the page is closed or refreshed.  

The interface is designed with a **dark theme** and a **table/column layout** for better readability. Buttons and interactive elements feature **hover effects** for a polished, professional look. This project demonstrates practical use of DOM manipulation, event handling, and local storage in a real-world web app, making it an excellent showcase of Vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS skills.
